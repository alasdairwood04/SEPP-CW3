In order to support the move to hybrid teaching, the University is supporting undergraduate and postgraduate students who are most in need with medium to long-term laptop loans.  The loans are focused on those who do not have a device or their current device does not support teaching requirements.

The laptops are available to those who are:

- care leavers
- estranged
- acting as a carer
- in receipt of a University bursary based on household income
- in receipt of discretionary and hardship funds
- currently working from a tablet or phone to access lectures and teaching material
- in severe financial difficulty unable to purchase or repair a laptop

The laptop loan system is for the purpose of providing a working primary device and not about upgrading from your existing device or obtaining a second device. This is to ensure these laptops help those who are most in need.
