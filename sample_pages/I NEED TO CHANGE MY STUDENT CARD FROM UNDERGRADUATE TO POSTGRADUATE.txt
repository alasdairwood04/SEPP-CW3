You will need to visit one of the Card Help Desks to get a new card produced. See https://edin.ac/2Ebk8fB

The photo showing in the Student Personal Details channel in MyEd will be used to create your card.

If you wish to have a new photograph, you will have to complete an Edhelp Enquiry Form and attach a photograph.

What if I still need help?

If you still need help, please complete an EdHelp Enquiry form (https://edin.ac/3DABP2D) and we will contact you.
