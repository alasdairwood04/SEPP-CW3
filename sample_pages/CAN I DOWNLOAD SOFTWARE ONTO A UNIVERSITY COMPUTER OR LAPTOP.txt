Medium and long-term loan laptops

If you borrowed a laptop through the medium or long-term loan scheme launched in the 2019/20 session (you would have collected this from Old College), these have basic factory settings so again, you should be able to download any software you need.


Laptops borrowed from schools

Rules for laptops borrowed from schools vary. Some will come pre-loaded with all the software you should need to complete the work set by your department. Others will allow you to download software from the Software Centre app, usually subject to approval.  Bespoke software would have to be requested via a support call (please see below) and may not always be approved.
